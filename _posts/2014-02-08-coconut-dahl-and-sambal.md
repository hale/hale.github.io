Delicious, healthy and cheap, dahl is my favourite meal to make
regularly. This recipe is more involved than what I would usually do, and is from a
new book on my shelf: Madhur Jaffrey's World Vegetarian.

The coconut dahl is wonderfully creamy and sweet and since it's mostly lentils
very filling. The sambal is a reccommended addition to counter the smoothness of
the lentils, and is made with a hot chilli powder.

The following recipe makes a large saucepan of dahl which will last for a week
or so in the fridge. For the sambal, consult Madhur Jaffrey's excellent book!

*Combine the following ingredients in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan and bring
to the boil. Cover, leaving the lid slightly ajar, turn heat to low and cook
very gently for 60 minutes, or until the dahl has a thick soupy texture. Add
approximately 3tsp of salt and remove the cinnamon stick, goraka, chillies
and curry leaves.*

    12oz red lentils, washed thoroughly
    1 pint canned coconut milk
    1tsp tumeric powder
    2 3" sticks of cinnamon
    30 fresh curry leaves
    2 pieces goraka
    8 tablespoons finely chopped onion
    4 dried red chillis
    4 fresh green chillies, cut in half
    32floz water

*Once the lentils have cooked, they're seasoned with a tarka. Measure and set
aside all the ingredients before you start adding them to oil, since everything
cooks very quickly.*

    4tbps vegetable oil
    2 3" sticks of cinnamon
    4 dried red chillies
    2 fresh green chillies, whole
    30 fresh curry leaves
    2 small onions, peeled and finely choppes
    12floz canned coconut milk.
    2tbps fresh lime juice

*Put the oil in a small frying pan and set over a medium-high heat. When hot, put
in the cinnamon sticks and whole red and green chillies. Stir for 10 seconds,
then put in the curry leaves. Stir once and put in the onion. Stir and cook
until the onion pieces start to brown. Add the coconut milk. Stir and cook for 2
minutes. Pour this micture, oil and seasonings into the pan with the lentils.
Add the lime juice, stir and remove from the heat &#x25A0;*
