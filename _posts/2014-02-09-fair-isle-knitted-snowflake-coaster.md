description: Showing off the finished coaster, a simple pattern by Martin Storey and my first go at Fair Isle knitting.
---

I've been knitting for about a year, but have so far only made simple objects
with thick wool and large needles.  I have always loved Fair Isle patterns and
have been looking longingly through Martin Storey's patterns, wishing I was able
to make them.

This is his smallest and quickest item from a book called Nordic Knits, and is
knitted in beautifully soft Rowan Felted Tweed DK wool.

I'm pleased with how it turned out: blocking with pins evened out the stitches
and fixed the too-tight cast-off nicely.

It's important when knitting Fair Isle to keep the strands loose at the back, so
that your knitting retains the natural give and doesn't bunch up when flattened.
I haven't yet got to grips with continental-style knitting, which means this
took a long time to knit up, athough the slow progress does mean the strands are
nicely spaces apart:

All in all I was pleased with how easy this pattern turned out to be: I was sure
I'd make some terrible mistake or miss stitches etc, but fortunately managed to
spot all but one of the mistakes and fix them in time.
