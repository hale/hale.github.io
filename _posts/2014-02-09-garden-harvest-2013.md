Growing up in Somerset, I've always loved being outdoors whatever the weather.
Living in a city has brought home the fact that unless you make the effort, all
you see is pavements and the inside of buildings.

Last year I decided to grow vegetables in our shared garden, as an excuse to
work on a project away from the desk and with the prospect of delicious
vegetables come summer / autumn.

The garden is used a bit by the other residents of the building, but not much.
The downside of this is there was a fair bit of work to do...but it meant we
could use all the beds without objection from everyone else.

Everything was grown from seed, and the seeds were bought from the Real Seed
Catalogue, which specialise in heirloom and heritage vegetable varieties.

This year we decided to grow:

* Leaf Beet (aka 'Perpetual Spinach')
* Czar Runner Beans
* Bleu de Solaise Leek
* Verde di Milano Dwarf Courgette
* Waltham Butternut Squash
* Costuluto Genovese Tomato

During April / early May, the first batch of seeds were sown on the windowsill -
the tomatoes, squashes and courgettes:

Meanwhile outside, the earth was turned and compost added in preparation for
planting out the seedlings:

By the end of may, it was getting warm enough for the seedlings to be planted
out.  I created some cloche coverings using fleece to keep out any bad weather,
since this far north it can still get cold and windy this early in the year.
The spinach plants probably didn't need it, however; once grown they survived
the winter, so I doubt a bit of wind would have done much harm.

The canes in the following picture are supporting the runner beans, and the pots contain
young tomato plants. The small cloches in the corner of the garden contain the
butternut squash and courgette plants.

And finally, the fruits of our labour! The squashes alas were too slow to
ripen, and none were big enough to be edible. The spinach was incredibly
prolific, but bolted after a couple of weeks of very intense heat and no water
since we were both away. The leeks had not grown to a large enough size, and
have been over-wintered until they mature fully.

We had tonnes of tomatoes from 3 of the 4 vines (the other pot got too dry and
failed to set), and predictable more beans than could be managed.

All in all a successful season.  Next time I'll plant much less spinach, and if
we ever try winter squashes again remember to set the seed a few weeks earlier.
It's amazing how the full repercussions of a schedule set in place in February
are not felt until 6+ months later. It would have only taken a few weeks for
several of the butternut squashes to ripen fully. Well, here's to 2014!
