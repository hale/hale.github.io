How do you pick which language to teach people programming?

1. It's about the ecosystem as a whole.

It's not just about the syntax of the language, but the library's and resources
and community that comes along with it.

2. It has to be platform agnostic.

Everyone will have their own preferences, so pick something which isn't picky
about the environment it's used in.  Note that as per point 1) this isn't just
about whether a compiler or interpreter exists.  For example, you can use ruby
on Windows but it's a poor choice since everybody assumes you're on \*nix.

3. Staff should have a good understanding of the language

Just because the students are new to the language doesn't mean you can be too.
You can afford to experiment and not know the intricate details when you're
learning yourself, because you have the experience to know how to get out of
trouble. Crucially, a knowledgable response which doesn't quite make sense yet is
way more inspiring than pointing to the documentation.
