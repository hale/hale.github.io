      My name is Phil and I'm a senior full-stack engineer working on digital transformation in the
      public sector.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have over seven years of commercial experience working in modern web stacks, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lead developer on multi-year, multi-million dollar projects.</li>
      <li>Owned the product and built relationships with high-value clients.</li>
      <li>Conversion of legacy Rails apps to modern, scalable API + React-based systems.</li>
      <li>Set up and managed data analytics pipelines.</li>
      <li>First technical hire on a now-public company.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I perform best in product-driven teams, with people who are in it for the long-haul and are
      practical about getting stuff done.
