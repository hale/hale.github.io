  <p>
    I've been making things with Ruby on Rails since 2009.  In that time I've
    worked on everything from open-source collaborations to large high-traffic
    applications with several hundred-thousand lines of code.
  </p>
  <p>
    I conduct myself professionally, and hopefully this is evident in what I
    deliver.
