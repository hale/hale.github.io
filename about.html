Name:       Philip Hale
Location:   Aberdeen, UK
Occupation: Full time student, freelance web developer

I've been making things with Ruby on Rails since 2009.  In
that time I've worked on everything from open-source
collaborations to large high-traffic applications with
several hundred-thousand lines of code.

I conduct myself professionally, and hopefully this is
evident in what I deliver.
