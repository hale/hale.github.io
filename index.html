    <p>
      Hello,
    </p>
    <p>
      I create dynamic content for the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm interested in software craftsmanship and am most inspired by
      developers who are great communicators as well as knowledgeable
      engineers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm currently contracting as a Ruby developer and learning more about
      data analysis and visualisation.
    <p>
      You can read more about my professional skills and experiences on this
      site, or get in touch at phil@pghale.com.
