    <p>
      Hello,
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been working on web applications since 2009. My experience is mostly
      with Ruby on Rails, and I've also written apps in AngularJS, Backbone.js
      and Play.
    </p>
    <p>
      My time is currently split between studying for a BSc in Computing Science
      at Aberdeen University and maintaining Honolulu Answers.  When I'm not
      doing that you will find me knitting, gardening or trying new recipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      From here you can read more about my professional skills and experience,
      or see a list of hobby-related things I've posted about.
