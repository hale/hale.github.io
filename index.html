      Hi,
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been working on web applications since 2009, mostly in Ruby on
      Rails. I also have experience with client-side JavaScript frameworks like
      AngularJS and Backbone.
    </p>
    <p>
      My time is currently split between studying for a BSc in Computing
      Science at Aberdeen University and maintaining Honolulu Answers.
